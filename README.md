### Getting started

The code is written and tested with Matlab 2017a. Modifications might be necessary to run it with other versions of Matlab.

### Installing 

```
git clone https://github.com/vohuy93/OSD.git
```

```
cd OSD
```

### Dependencies

You need to download the code for generating region proposals with randomized Prim's algorithm and put it in the UODOptim/ folder

```
git clone https://github.com/smanenfr/rp.git
```

then run

```
cd rp; matlab -r "setup"
```

## Running the tests

The main script for testing the code on VOC_6x2 is scripts/run_UOD.m. In a terminal, from the UODOptim folder, run 

```
cd scripts; matlab -r "run_OSD"
```
